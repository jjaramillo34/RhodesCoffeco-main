        content: `
            <p>The journey from military service to coffee service might seem like an unusual path, but the core values remain the same: dedication, precision, and service to others. As a veteran-owned business, Rhodes Coffee Co. brings these military-instilled values to every cup we serve.</p>

            <h2>Military Precision Meets Coffee Perfection</h2>
            <p>The attention to detail learned in the military translates perfectly to crafting the perfect cup of coffee. Every drink we serve is made with the same level of care and precision that was demanded in military service. This commitment to excellence is evident in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully measured ingredients</li>
                <li>Precisely timed extractions</li>
                <li>Consistently maintained equipment</li>
                <li>Rigorous quality control</li>
                <li>Disciplined service standards</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Building Community Through Coffee</h2>
            <p>Just as the military builds strong bonds between service members, we're building connections in our community through coffee. Our mobile coffee cart doesn't just serve beverages; it creates gathering spaces where people can connect, share stories, and build relationships.</p>

            <h2>Values That Guide Us</h2>
            <p>The military values continue to guide our business practices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrity in sourcing and service</li>
                <li>Excellence in every cup</li>
                <li>Dedication to customer satisfaction</li>
                <li>Respect for our community</li>
                <li>Service above self</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We're proud to bring these values to every event we serve, creating experiences that honor both our military background and our commitment to exceptional coffee service.</p>
