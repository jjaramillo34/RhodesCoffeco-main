        review: "Rhodes Coffee is a must, every chance we get. Tricia's dream has transformed a corner of our tiny town into a gathering place for friends. She is a magician of coffee syrups and tasty concoctions that leave you impatiently waiting for the next list of specials. Today, I had peach syrup in my latte and it was one of my absolute favorite cups of coffee, EVER. Her treats are so inclusive, gluten free items and I love that they're not overly sweet.",

We invited them to be part of our vendors for our nonprofit's 60th anniversary, and they did not disappoint! Even communication leading up to the event was seamless. Highly recommend.",
